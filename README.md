# [React/Node/Mongo] exercice-me

Build a simple website to talk about you

## Brief

Build an app in order to explain who you are, what you have done and what you are doing

## Menu

Your app should have at least 3 main entries:
- List of your work
- Contact
- Who are you

You can also add link to your favorite social network: Insta, Github, LinkedIn, etc....

## Ideas

- Click on a work within a list should send you to a more detailed page about selected work
- Contact should offer a map component and a form
- You can display somewhere a list of recent tweet/insta etc... of your choice
- Do not forget icons and other design elements

## Atomic design / Storybook

- You have to follow basics of Atomic Desing principle
- You have to provide a Storybook of all your Atoms/Molecules/Organisms/Templates/Pages
- All part of your design system should be tested accordingly (BDD or TDD)

## Read only

At least, you have to provide an API (no need for authentication) to retrieve:
- List of work
- Detail of a work
- Text about who you are
- Contact information
- Any relevant information you can think about

## Bonus

- CRUD on all API endpoint
- GraphQL, why not :)
- Insomnia or Postman implementation of API
- Storybook deployed on Github page
- List of your github repositories somewhere
- List of your design work hosted somewhere (equivalent of Github for developpers)

## What are we waiting for

- A functionnal app
- At least 80% of code coverage
- No warning within console when running app
- A functionnal storybook
